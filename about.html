				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>"For every one of us, living in this world means waiting for our end. Let whoever can win glory before death. When a warrior is gone, that will be his best and only bulwark” (Lines 1384-1389). Beowulf believes that glory is both the driving force and goal a warrior should strive for. He continues to say that the only thing that matters about a warrior after his death is the glory of what he did in life. From this, it can be assumed that Beowulf is very material and goal oriented. </p>

				<h3>Beliefs and Cultural Values</h3>
				<p>“Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke: Wise sir, do not grieve. It is always better to avenge dear ones than to indulge in mourning. For every one of us, living in this world Means waiting for our end” (Lines 1384-1388). Beowulf see the meaning of life as death. He does not believe mourning is the way to respond to death and that to seek to redeem another's death is the correct response. </p>

				<h3>Personality</h3>
				<p>“A protector of his people, pledged to uphold truth and justice and to respect tradition, is entitled to affirm that this man was born to distinction” (Lines 1700-1704). Beowulf was a loyal and protective man who held morals in high regaurd. He was a man of tradition</p>

				<h3>Place in Society</h3>
				<p>"The veteran king sat down on the cliff-top" (Line 2404). Beowulf was of noble blood, his uncle being the previous king. He later ascends to the throne and elevates his noble status as high as it can go.</p>

				<h3>Religion</h3>
				<p>"Whichever one death fells must deem it a just judgement by God" (Lines 440-441). He believes death to be chosen by god showing how much he believes in the Christian God's will. He calls death specificaly a "just judgement of God" meaning he thinks it fair and as it should be.  </p>

				<h3>Physical Description</h3>
				<p>“A thane, they declared, with the strength of thirty In the grip of each hand” (380-81). From his grip strength alone Beowulf must be physically imposing. He shows impossible feats of strength that could only be possible with an equally imposible physique. </p>

				<h3>Actions</h3>
				<p>"So every elder and experienced councilman among my people supported my resolve to come here to you" (Lines 415-417). Beowulf's actions are heroic because he chooses to slay Grendal not only to pay off debt but because he believes it to be rightious. His own people support his resolve and bolster his confidence in heroism.</p>
